## Keller Door Guard

A diy solution to protect against thieves in the storage room by making sure
that the front door is always locked.

The little guard kit here will detect if the door is locked with a distance
sensor that should be installed in the hole of the lock. A light sensor
is responsible to check if lights are open because of human movement.

If the door is left unlocked and no one is inside then it will trigger an alarm
and it will inform the tenants through IoT cloud services.

### Hardware 
The hardware consists of two modules, one internal that monitors the lock and the lights 
and one external that sends the notifications.
